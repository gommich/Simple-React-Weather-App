I built this app by following a Udemy.com tutorial on react and redux. It compiles with webpack and runs via command: npm start

Running the APP:

cd into WeatherWebApp via the command line

enter: npm start

Open a browser and type in: localhost:8080

Enter a city that you would like to find the weather for:

eg: Paris

It should come up with some weather information.
